Observable Trends:

1. The vast majority of players are Male with 484 followed by a distant 81 females as well as a menial 11 non-disclosed gender players. One could surmise there is a large population that is not being marketed to where profit could be captured. This company would do well to analyze what female and non disclosed genders look for in a game such as this to drive market share and increase profit. 
2. Most players fall into the 20-24 category. We see a sharp dip in players in the 25-29 category. There could be several reasons behind this - increasing family respoinsibility, career, etc.. it could potentially be a worthwhile investment to find out if this age group simply migrates to another game of similar type. How can we keep our players of a longer period of time?
3. The most profitable items almost exactly match the most popular items. What is causing this correlation? Can we increase the popularity of other items to increase profitability on those items? Are these items more powerful, visually appealing etc.. find out why the top items are there, and apply that to the least popular items. 


Heroes of Pymoli

Congratulations! After a lot of hard work in the data munging mines, you've landed a job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. You've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.
Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.
Your final report should include each of the following:

Player Count

Total Number of Players


Purchasing Analysis (Total)

Number of Unique Items
Average Purchase Price
Total Number of Purchases
Total Revenue


Gender Demographics

Percentage and Count of Male Players
Percentage and Count of Female Players
Percentage and Count of Other / Non-Disclosed


Purchasing Analysis (Gender)

You must submit a link to your Github/Git Lab repo that contains your Jupyter Notebook.
You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
